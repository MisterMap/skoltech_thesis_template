\section{Theoretical background}
\subsection{Robot perception}
As been mentioned above robot consists of three main parts: that sense, that think and that act.
The main goal of robot perception part of software is to produce useful information to robot action system. In our case it produce two main information robot position in the world and robot map.
\subsection{What is SLAM?}
When a robot knows a map it can easily localize itself. This problem is known as localization. On the other hand if robot is knows self trajectory, it can construct a map based on this information. But both map and trajectory is unknown the problem becomes more sophisticated robot must solve localization and mapping problem jointly. This is known as SLAM problem. 
The basis of SLAM is developed in
